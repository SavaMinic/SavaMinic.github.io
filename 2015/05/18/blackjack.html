<p>In order to energize ourself at Nordeus, we organized an internal game jam during May of 2015, with free theme and genre.<br />
It was just to have casual fun making something fast in 48h (without all-nighters), and get to know each other better and get motivation boost.<br />
I made team with <a href="https://twitter.com/VoxelBoy">VoxelBoy</a>, so the jamming could begin.</p>

<p>It’s normal blackjack rules, but with <del>hookers</del> assistants.<br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>you play blackjack, and gain/spend money as usual<br /></li>
  <li>you can “invest” your money to:<br />
– buy items - pimp your looks to jaw-dropping heights, increases your “coolness” <br />
– unlock one of the “assistants” - which have their special powers<br /></li>
  <li>“coolness” decrease price of “assistants”, so you need to prioritize<br /></li>
  <li>gain as much as you can before reaching zero, and then “CASH OUT” which will send the score to the leaderboard, but it restarts the game<br /></li>
  <li>gain eternal fame and glory by becoming the best on the leaderboard<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Each one has special power, and when you use it, it has cooldown before you can use it again.<br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>card counting</strong> - you get current True count on decks (<a href="http://casinogambling.about.com/od/blackjack/a/hilo.htm">Hi Lo card counting</a>)<br /></li>
  <li><strong>distract the dealer</strong> - in next dealing, he stands on 19 (normally he would stand on 17)<br /></li>
  <li><strong>double double down</strong> - same rules as normal double down, but you increase 200% on initial bet<br /></li>
  <li><strong>card eater</strong> - ignores the last dealt card (if card busted your hand, too bad, still can’t save you)<br />
and ones with passive powers:<br /></li>
  <li><strong>queen of hearts</strong> - for every queen of hearts in your hand, you get 69$ (she is rich, and she loves that card)<br /></li>
  <li><strong>lucky lady</strong> - gives you advantage in push (instead of returning your bet, you get 150% of original bet)<br /></li>
  <li><strong>increase blackjack win</strong> - instead of 3:2 payout when you have blackjack, it’s 5:2<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>More to come in upcoming DLCs :)</p>
