Today is April 28th, and this will be the place where I will blog my experience of releasing free2play mobile game in 1 week.
<br />

I want to go through whole process of it, from development to release and tweaking, and since I'm not an artist I will be using free graphic assets.<br />

<h2>GAME IDEA - 28.4.2018.</h2>

It's going to be very casual game with endless highscore level, without timers but with rewards progression (more you play, better score multiplier you get).
<br />

Inspired by "5 in a line" kind of games, for example <a href='http://vsg.quasihome.com/lines/index.html' target='\_blank'>Color lines</a>,<br />
except it's going to have kind of progression where by: <br /> <b>... getting high scores -> you will get reward points -> you use to level up color elements -> they give you more points during playing -> you getting more high scores ...</b>

I plan to make only basic leaderboards, and releasing on Android and iOS. Maybe I will check the app size for Facebook Instant games, but that's a stretch :p<br />
Game should be easily re-skinnable, because I plan to test multiple art themes (animas, flowers, robots, candies ...) with same gameplay.
