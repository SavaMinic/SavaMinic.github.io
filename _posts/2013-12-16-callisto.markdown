Space exploration game, worked between themes 'You only get one' and 'Colonisation sim'. 

<img class="def_image" src="/img/callisto/shot1.jpg" />

You need to colonize the Callisto moon, second biggest Jupiter's moon with 4 rovers. 
Since there is a lot of distance between Earth and Callisto, YOU ONLY GET ONE command per 2s!!! 

* Mine the ore (green) and transport it back to base (red). 
* Move around mountains (brown) and beware of the sand pits (black), by watching for sand (yellow) which surrounds them. 
* Rovers have also limited power, so you need to return them to base to recharge. 

```
Standard 1-4 for rovers. 
NUMPAD/QWE-ASD-ZXC for commands. 
P is cheat for showing whole map. 
```

### P.S. Didn't have time to implement building and more obstacles, which would maybe include some fun into this game :P
