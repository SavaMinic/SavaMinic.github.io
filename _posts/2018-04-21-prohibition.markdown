In year 1920, United States were struck with alcohol prohibition.

But it didn’t stop alcohol selling. In fact mobs were earning more money than ever in history.

Secret bar, also known as “Speakeasy” were saviors of the masses. Thus the name, because people were not supposed to spread news about them.

Many heists of speakeasies made bartenders top class investigators, as they were supposed to find out who’s civilian, and who’s a secret agent.

Making a mistake and serving agent with alcohol led to prison, or even death.
