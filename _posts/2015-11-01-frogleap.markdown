### PLAY THE GAME : [Windows](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_YUM1pJMrsZWWxNX3NMUjVIRDA) [Mac](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_YUM1pJMrsZLUZ0cEhWTXNaaDA) [Source](https://github.com/SavaMinic/8plus1)

I had some free time to spare, and was in mood for jamming, so I made a simple puzzle game for my aunt.

Green and red frogs need to change their places (green go right, red go left). A frog can jump one step in front, or leap just over 1 frog.

UI is in Serbian, but it is very simple puzzle.
