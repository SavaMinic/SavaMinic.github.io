Last night, around 50 game enthusiasts and professionals gathered for the latest event hosted by [Game Dev Guild Serbia](https://www.instagram.com/gamedevguild.rs/), "To Game Dev and Beyond"!<br />
It was an interesting evening full of learning, inspiration, and networking with new faces from the game development community.<br />

We kicked things off with a series of insightful talks from our fantastic lineup of speakers:<br />
[Yaroslav Kravtsov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaroslav-kravtsov-883bb333/) (Co-founder @ Space Trace) gave a fascinating talk on the future of Roblox, reminding us that "18 years is only the beginning!"<br />
[Vitalii Abramov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitaly-abramov/) (Executive Producer @ Narwhal Accelerator) provided invaluable insights into the funding ecosystem in todayâ€™s game development market, leaving attendees with new strategies and ideas for their own projects.<br />
[Evgenii Novikov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enovikov11/) (Technical Manager @ Yandex and Indie Game Developer) inspired the crowd with his journey into game development as a passion, sharing that "If you're passionate, nothing will stop you!"<br />

After the talks, participants enjoyed a relaxed Q&A session, followed by some chill-out time where everyone could mingle, share stories, and connect with other like-minded developers.<br />
