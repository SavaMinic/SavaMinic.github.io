[The Global Game Jam 2024](https://globalgamejam.org/)  just finished with sky-rocket numbers of 34,588 participants at 796 locations in 102 countries all over the world 🏆 .<br />

It was the biggest Global Game Jam Belgrade (yet), with 143 participants who made 39 games, and I want to thank all the participants who made it happen, having fun, meeting new people, and strengthening the game-making community. You can try their games [HERE](https://globalgamejam.org/jam-sites/2024/global-game-jam-belgrade-2024)<br />

This would be much harder without the support of our friends at [PLAYSTUDIOS EUROPE](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playstudios-europe/), who provided their extraordinary space and snacks for everyone.
We are very thankful to [Coca-Cola HBC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coca-cola-hbc/) for keeping us refreshed during GGJ 🚀🥤, and [Wolt](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wolt-oy/), who got our back with vouchers to ensure everyone stays fueled for the 48-hour challenge! 🍔🚀<br />

Last but not least, I want to thank all the co-organizers: [Toma Paleček](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomapalecek/), [Miroslav Maksimović](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maksimovicmiroslav/), [Neda Stamenković](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nedastamenkovic/), [Marija Ljubojević](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marija-ljubojevi%C4%87-b7b576242/), [Jakov Peric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakov-peric-0a8906276/), Dejan Babić, [Andrija Lazić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrija-lazi%C4%87-dia/) and [Nikola Šobajić](https://www.nikolasobajic.com/).
