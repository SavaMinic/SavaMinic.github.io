Thanks a lot to the panelists: [Neda StamenkoviÄ‡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nedastamenkovic/), [Bogdan JociÄ‡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdan-jocic/), [Nikola MihailoviÄ‡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikola-mihailovic-a305a2255/) and [Milica TodoroviÄ‡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milicatodorovic/) for a truly amazing conversation!<br />
