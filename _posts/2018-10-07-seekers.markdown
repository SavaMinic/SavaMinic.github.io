### PLAY THE GAME : [Rules](https://savam.itch.io/seekers-in-darkness)

This was first time I enrolled into making a tabletop RPG game in 48h, with additional limit of 200 words for the rules.
It was very challenging and fun experience as the hard limit really pushed on making decisions.<br />

Theme was ["The sun is dead"](https://itch.io/jam/micro-rpg-jam), which immediately inspired me in direction of frozen planet, remains of civilization surviving in underground colonies, with harsh and dangerous environment.<br />

I wanted to have both setting, skills, fights, some weapons and enemies, and setup for first scenario.
In just 200 words, I had to make a lot of compromises :p<br />

<i>The sun is dead.<br /><br />
200 years ago, remains of humanity sheltered into underground colonies, harnessing the energy of Earthâ€™s core.<br /><br />
Only the fittest Seekers travel between distant colonies, exploring the lethal surface.<br />
