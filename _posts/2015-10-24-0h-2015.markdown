### PLAY THE GAME : [Windows](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_YUM1pJMrsZdGRzbk5Wd2xiV0U) [Mac](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_YUM1pJMrsZOGVsYWRwTXBzLVU) [Android](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_YUM1pJMrsZdEVscXE4SXVUZU0) [Source](https://github.com/SavaMinic/0hGame2015)

This was very interesting experience, as ["0 hour game jame"](http://0hgame.eu/) says:<br />
***During DST hour shift, we shift clocks backwards, so there's actually 1 hour between 2:00 am and 2:00 am. This is the best time in the year to make a game! Make a game in zero hours!***

Since there is no time to prototype or even think about the gameplay, I just went with the first thing that popped on my mind.

*Uncover the ancient symbols, knowledge is one that matters.*<br />
"**Connected worlds**" is kind of a memory game, where you need to memorize and reproduce one of the colors, and you will get "translation" of those symbols in a form of a haiku.

Not done entirely in 0h :( <br />
I created the barebone project files before the 2AM, then went to sleep, and wake up at 2:40AM :(
I missed the mark for 3->2AM, and then left for an hour more.
