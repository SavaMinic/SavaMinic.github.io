We wanted to have an unique event to warm up for the GMTK Jam so we organized the PUB QUIZ - a test of your knowledge on video games, mixed up with trivia on the usual game jam lore 🍄!<br />

Our Game Jam Pub Quiz took place last Wednesday, and it went pretty well! It was amazing to see our community brought together once again 💜🤗💚
Congrats to the winner team who aced the quiz 💪🏻

Our amazing [Toma Paleček](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomapalecek/) and [Miroslav Maksimović](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maksimovicmiroslav/) did an *amazing* job as quiz hosts 🎤

Special thanks to [Anastasija Jankovic](https://www.instagram.com/_vidda__/) for capturing our event 📸

And of course, thanks [Nordeus](linkedin.com/company/nordeus/) for providing us with the beautiful space and drinks 🧡✨
