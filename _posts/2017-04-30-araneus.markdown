### PLAY THE GAME : [Windows + Mac](http://gamejolt.com/games/araneus/253259)  [Source](https://github.com/SavaMinic/ld38)

Although Ludum Dare 38 was special, as it was 15th birthday of this great event, I couldn't participate (i was travelling abroad).<br />
I organized myself to make a game for LD38 theme, "A small world" weekend after, just for my motivation.<br />

Here goes "Araneus : Madness of the wicked one" :)

Once upon a time,<br />
there was a great<br />
guitar player.<br />
HE WANTED TO BE THE BEST!<br />
<br />
He tried to play the forbidden song,<br />
but the DEMONS never rest.<br />
<br />
DEMON from the hell awoken,<br />
"WHO ARE YOU to BREAK MY SLUMBER?"<br />
"Be small and silent" - he said,<br />
"Let 8 be your number!"<br />
<br />
Into the spider he turned,<br />
no tongue to speak left.<br />
To have revenge,<br />
holy grenades he has to get!<br />

It was great feeling to do something not focused on mobiles (basically, don't caring about performance that much).<br />
Since my modeling and composing skills are poor, I am very thankful to the authors providing free resources online:<br />
