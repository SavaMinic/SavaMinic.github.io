Indie Game Showcase finished and we still can’t believe we had so many fresh games showcasing (27), and was having busy crowd playing games the whole day (250+ people).
<br />
You can check out the [GAMES LIST](https://docs.google.com/document/d/154j-XW_lmTjzbtitredpEDDEiRqAG72UQddx1o-nafI/edit?tab=t.0).
<br />

Small but efficient crew can make wonders 💪 <br />
This was basically a cooperation led by [Julia Novikova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-novikova-271435233/) from [Whatevers Team](https://t.me/whateversstudio), supported by our guild regulars: [Miroslav Maksimović](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maksimovicmiroslav/) , [Toma Paleček](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomapalecek/) and [Andrija Lazić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrija-lazi%C4%87-dia/).<br />
Thanks for leading and supporting the local community.
<br />

And also, super grateful to [Prostor Miljenko Dereta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prostor-miljenko-dereta/) for opening their doors to these creative and inspiring game-makers ❤️ <br />
