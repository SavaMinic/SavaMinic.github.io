This year Global Game Jam in Belgrade was a record-breaking one, with 22 teams and little more than 100 jammers. It was held in 2 locations, but game presentations were done in the same space, which was awesome. Big thanks to **[Ranko Trifkovic](https://twitter.com/RankoTrifkovic)**, and also **[Nordeus Hub](https://www.facebook.com/nordeushub/)** and **[StartIt](https://www.facebook.com/startitcentar/)** for hosting the event.

This year theme was:
**<center>REPAIR</center>**

I joined forces with amazing jammers from last year, **[Nothke](https://twitter.com/Nothke/)** and **[Stihilus](https://twitter.com/Stihilus)** , but also we had help from young **[Subiicus](https://twitter.com/subiicus)** , future Game dev star :)

We had some problems with coming up with an idea for the game, that we all were hyped about, but after exhausting Friday night we come up with this premise:
"Trip through Yugoslavia in the '80s. Repair your relationship. Repair your Yugo."<br />

We completely went nuts with [Yugo nostalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo), and later even added music from that era into the game (Thanks to YouTube :D). <br />

So basically, it's game for 2 players, a married couple with marriage problems, traveling from Belgrade to Adriatic sea, hoping to repair their estranged relationship, but also repairing their Yugo car which breaks all the time. <br />

Nothke outdid himself by making different parts of the levels, which then combine into a bigger level so every run is different.<br />
There are 3 big areas:<br >
- Serbia (from [Genex Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_City_Gate)), over Drina river,
- through Bosnia, to [Mostar bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stari_Most),
- and then to Croatia coastline toward the final destination - amazing [Adriatic sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea).<br />

Stihilus did awesome job with both 3d props (as amazing as Yugo can be), trees, signs and other stuff, but also with 2d art - which represents your married couple trying to remember their past, and if both of them pick the right memory, their relationship improves.<br />

When Yugo gets broken, it's job for 2 to pick the parts and repair the Yugo, so you can continue your journey towards Adriatic, hoping to repair your relationship.<br />

I had an amazing time working on this game jam, and feel really happy to be part of the growing Global Game Jam community in Belgrade (and the world).<br />
It was a very productive game jam, as you can see the progress we had.
