It is always a great feeling to share learnings with others, meet new interesting people and learn new “gamedev” war stories 🎮🎲l👾<br />
<br />
Thanks to WN Events who organized [Live Ops Summit](https://wnhub.io/event-info/liveops-summit-belgrade-25) here in Belgrade, and [Antonio Pasalic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-pasalic/) and [Oleg Nesterenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleg-nesterenko-1842366b/) for inviting me, I had an opportunity to share insights on everchanging [Nordeus’](https://nordeus.com/) liveops in “Beyond the World Cup: Evolving a Live Event in Top Eleven”.<br /><br />
