In **"Like a Candy from a Baby,"** you are in the role of a candy-craving five-year-old in the kindergarten, surrounded by babies (oh, those poor tiny creatures).<br />

[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56/$396094) 56 has finished 🚀<br />
This time, there was an organized location at [DC Krov](https://www.instagram.com/dc.krov/), which was very fun to participate.<br />
I was a bit late for the start, so the teams already formed, so I was working alone on a theme:<br />

**<center>Tiny Creatures</center>**

Up to 4 players compete to be the first to collect five candies, running, jumping, and throwing stuff around.<br />
Your goal is to grab candy and hold it while sneaky babies try to steal it from you.<br />
Use quick moves and tricks to outsmart your friends, take their candy, and win the game!<br />
<br />

Controls are focused on joystick, although players 3 and 4 can be on keyboard:<br />
Player 1: Move (Joystick 1 stick) Hold/release (button 2), Jump (button 1)<br />
Player 2: Move (Joystick 2 stick) Hold/release (button 2), Jump (button 1)<br />
Player 3: Move (Joystick 3 stick) Hold/release (button 2), Jump (button 1)<br />
....Player 3 (Alternate): Move (W/A/S/D) Hold/release (E), Jump (Space)<br />
Player 4: Move (Joystick 4 stick) Hold/release (button 2), Jump (button 1)<br />
....Player 4 (Alternate): Move (Arrows) Hold/release (O), Jump (P)<br />
