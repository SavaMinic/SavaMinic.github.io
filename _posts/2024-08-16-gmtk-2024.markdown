We finished summer with the bang - another [GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024) location was organized in the August ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥<br />

The game jam lasted a total of 4 days from August 16th to 20th. ðŸš€ This was a novelty compared to previous iterations when the event lasted the standard 48 hours. If somebody wanted to stay in the 48-hour format, there was be an option to submit the game for that category. ðŸ•’
<br />

The theme, "Built to Scale", offered a lot of room for interpretation, and it was great to see the range of ideas that came out of it. <br />

<br />
Around 90 participants attended, and the atmosphere was both focused and collaborative, as teams worked hard to bring their games to life.<br />
By the end, 18 games were presented from the 24 teams, though some didnâ€™t manage to finish in time or make it to the final showcase.<br />

Super thanks again to the [Playstudios Europe](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playstudios-europe/) for hosting both the event during the weekend and the games' presentations a couple of days later.<br />
