Serverless Code Camp is a community event for software developers interested in migrating to serverless architectures, or learning more about modern cloud deployment architectures.<br />
The participants create cloud functions to control virtual tanks, deploy them to serverless platforms such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, and wire them up to participate in a live tournament.
