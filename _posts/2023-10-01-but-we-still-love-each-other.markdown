After 48h, one more [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/but-we-still-love-each-other) has finished üöÄ<br />
This time, **[Stevan Popoviƒá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevan-popovi%C4%87-5724141b1/)** and I made the mini-game on the theme:<br />

**<center>LIMITED SPACE</center>**

It's a game for 2 players (Windows/Mac and Chrome), where the game's goal is to remain the only person on the bed.<br />
Although you are asleep, you can still nudge and control your movements (a bit).<br />
Even if someone falls off the bed, you still love each other ‚ù§Ô∏è<br />
<br />
Controls:<br />
Player 1: Head (Q / W), Torso (A / S), Legs (Z / X)<br />
Player 2: Head (U / I), Torso (J / K), Legs (N / M)<br />
