Happy holidays, everyone. We had a special Global Game Jam Belgrade pre-event happening next week. ðŸš€<br />
<br />
It was an insightful session with an awesome duo of veteran game jammers who shared their tips and tricks, just in time for the annual Global Game Jam 2024 (taking place on January 26-28).<br />
With the combined experience of more than 10+ years of game jamming, they talked about their learnings and motivations for making games in the game jams, and to inspire you in your future game projects.<br />
The event included a Q&A and chill-out time after the presentations.<br />
