[The Game Jam 33](https://www.instagram.com/gamejam.33/) was an event organized by the [Academy of Arts](https://www.instagram.com/akademijaumetnostinovisad) in Novi Sad, specifically department of the Video Game Design üèÜ .<br />

It was open to the Academy students (which were mostly illustrators, 3D artists, game designers, and sound designer), combined with selected game jam software developers (from all around).<br />

I was invited by the organizer, [≈Ωiva Stanojeviƒá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zivastanojevic/), the Assistant Professor at Academy of Arts, to be a mentor for the participants, for which I am very thankful as I had a lot of fun and met a lot of cool and proactive people.
