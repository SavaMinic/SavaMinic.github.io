### PLAY THE GAME : [Windows](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_YUM1pJMrsZRXloM0VESzJ0VWs) [Mac](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_YUM1pJMrsZWmxqU3ZNeXZVRGM) [Android](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_YUM1pJMrsZMTkwN19yUHlDeFU)

In order to energize ourself at Nordeus, we organized an internal game jam during May of 2015, with free theme and genre.<br />
It was just to have casual fun making something fast in 48h (without all-nighters), and get to know each other better and get motivation boost.<br />
I made team with [VoxelBoy](https://twitter.com/VoxelBoy), so the jamming could begin.

It's normal blackjack rules, but with ~~hookers~~ assistants.<br />
- you play blackjack, and gain/spend money as usual<br />
- you can "invest" your money to:<br />
-- buy items - pimp your looks to jaw-dropping heights, increases your "coolness" <br />
-- unlock one of the "assistants" - which have their special powers<br />
- "coolness" decrease price of "assistants", so you need to prioritize<br />
- gain as much as you can before reaching zero, and then "CASH OUT" which will send the score to the leaderboard, but it restarts the game<br />
- gain eternal fame and glory by becoming the best on the leaderboard<br />

Each one has special power, and when you use it, it has cooldown before you can use it again.<br />
- **card counting** - you get current True count on decks ([Hi Lo card counting](http://casinogambling.about.com/od/blackjack/a/hilo.htm))<br />
- **distract the dealer** - in next dealing, he stands on 19 (normally he would stand on 17)<br />
- **double double down** - same rules as normal double down, but you increase 200% on initial bet<br />
- **card eater** - ignores the last dealt card (if card busted your hand, too bad, still can't save you)<br />
and ones with passive powers:<br />
- **queen of hearts** - for every queen of hearts in your hand, you get 69$ (she is rich, and she loves that card)<br />
- **lucky lady** - gives you advantage in push (instead of returning your bet, you get 150% of original bet)<br />
- **increase blackjack win** - instead of 3:2 payout when you have blackjack, it's 5:2<br />

More to come in upcoming DLCs :)
