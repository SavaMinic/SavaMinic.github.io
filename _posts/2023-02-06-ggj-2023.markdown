One more [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) has ended, and with 33,663 participants in 788 locations across 107 countries, it managed to bring the game jam community together again, despite the pandemic. ❤️<br />
Although I have participated in many game-jam events, this is the first one I have organized. Thanks to the people who helped me, [Đorđe Nemet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djordjenemet/) and [Toma Paleček](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomapalecek/) were a huge support, while [Marko Moljković](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-moljkovi%C4%87-250718201/) and [Vera Bogdanović](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vera-bogdanovi%C4%87-66a94b227/) stepped in to capture the most exciting moments with their cameras. I am honestly very proud of the team that got together, socialized, and made games in those exciting 48 hours.<br />
95 participants (from high school students and beginners, through students and gaming enthusiasts, to industry veterans) managed to jointly complete 21 games (18 digital and 3 board games) 🏆🚀💪
Thank you for the motivation and super energy and for strengthening the community. This is just the beginning :)<br />
<br />
I want to thank Playstudios Europe for selflessly sharing their phenomenal space with us and giving the game-jam community a big boost.<br />
<br />
We are looking forward to the next game-jam events, probably even something before the start of the Global Game Jam next year.<br />
