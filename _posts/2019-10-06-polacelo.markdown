Although I was planning to do this Ludum Dare for the whole weekend, some family stuff got into the way :p .<br />
I had only Sunday evening to mock something up, which is cool because of the Ludum Dare theme:

**<center>START WITH NOTHING</center>**
<br />
Classic card skill game we played when we were young. <br />
The opponent chooses “HALF” or “FULL” while holding a card, while you try to hit the card and make both cards fall on the same side or opposite (depending on what opponent has chosen). <br />
Winners get both cards. <br />
