Although I was planning to do this Ludum Dare for the whole weekend, my cousin and nephew visited from my from home town, so I had only Sunday evening to mock something up. <br />
This year theme was:

**<center>START WITH NOTHING</center>**
<br />
Classic card skill game we played when we were young. <br />
The opponent chooses “HALF” or “FULL” while holding a card, while you try to hit the card and make both cards fall on the same side or opposite (depending on what opponent has chosen). <br />
Winners get both cards. <br />
