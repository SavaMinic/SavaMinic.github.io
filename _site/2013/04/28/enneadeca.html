<p>My first entry to the Ludum Dare contest.
I am very happy to see this game finished :)</p>

<p>Light up the world by passing all its points without hitting death ( red circles ).
By passing already lit point, you put it out.
Movement is 6-way directions:</p>
<div>
Q  W  E<br />
 \ | /<br />
 / | \<br />
A  S  D
</div>
<p>Power is SPACE, in which that point can not be put out.</p>

<p>Score is determined on number of light points, remaining powers and time spent.
Formula is:</p>

<div>
(LIGNT_POINTS - 1) * 100<br />
IF( LIGNT_POINTS &gt; 3) ADD (REMAINING_POWERS * 250)<br />
IF( VICTORY AND TIME_SPENT &lt; 60s ) ADD ( (60s - TIME_SPENT) * 30 )<br />
</div>

<p>I used HTML5 canvas as game environment, and since wanted to keep it minimalistic,
wrote simple engine for game (no sprites, particles, and stuff).</p>

<ul>

  <li>Music loop is <a href="http://www.looperman.com/loops?gid=21">downloaded for free</a></li>
  <li>No graphics :)</li>
</ul>
