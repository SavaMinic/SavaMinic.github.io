<p>You are disguised as normal citizen (blue) hiding from guards (yellow), and you need to eat all citizens by transforming into werewolf (red).</p>

<p>Guards chase you and try to kill you when you are revealed.</p>

<p>Every 13th eaten citizen, one inquisitor arrives, which is hidden (has blue color, but changes to orange when are you near him), and you need to avoid him (don’t try to kill him).</p>

<p>Kill all 32 citizens to win :)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS: <br />
Drag around screen to move. <br />
You can use (W) for activating Werewolf power, or clicking button in left.</p>
