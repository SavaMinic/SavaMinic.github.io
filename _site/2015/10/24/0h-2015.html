<p>This was very interesting experience, as <a href="http://0hgame.eu/">“0 hour game jame”</a> says:<br />
<strong><em>During DST hour shift, we shift clocks backwards, so there’s actually 1 hour between 2:00 am and 2:00 am. This is the best time in the year to make a game! Make a game in zero hours!</em></strong></p>

<p>Since there is no time to prototype or even think about the gameplay, I just went with the first thing that popped on my mind.</p>

<p><em>Uncover the ancient symbols, knowledge is one that matters.</em><br />
“<strong>Connected worlds</strong>” is kind of a memory game, where you need to memorize and reproduce one of the colors, and you will get “translation” of those symbols in a form of a haiku.</p>

<p>Not done entirely in 0h :( <br />
I created the barebone project files before the 2AM, then went to sleep, and wake up at 2:40AM :(
I missed the mark for 3-&gt;2AM, and then left for an hour more.</p>
