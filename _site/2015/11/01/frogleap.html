<p>I had some free time to spare, and was in mood for jamming, so I made a simple puzzle game for my aunt.</p>

<p>Green and red frogs need to change their places (green go right, red go left). A frog can jump one step in front, or leap just over 1 frog.</p>

<p>UI is in Serbian, but it is very simple puzzle.</p>
