<p>Space exploration game, worked between themes ‘You only get one’ and ‘Colonisation sim’.</p>

<p><img class="def_image" src="/img/callisto/shot1.jpg" /></p>

<p>You need to colonize the Callisto moon, second biggest Jupiter’s moon with 4 rovers. 
Since there is a lot of distance between Earth and Callisto, YOU ONLY GET ONE command per 2s!!!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mine the ore (green) and transport it back to base (red).</li>
  <li>Move around mountains (brown) and beware of the sand pits (black), by watching for sand (yellow) which surrounds them.</li>
  <li>Rovers have also limited power, so you need to return them to base to recharge.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Standard 1-4 for rovers. 
NUMPAD/QWE-ASD-ZXC for commands. 
P is cheat for showing whole map. 
</code></pre>
